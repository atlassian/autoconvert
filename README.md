# Atlassian Autoconvert TinyMCE Plugin
This plugin is an open source version of Atlassian's autoconvert feature. See: http://youtu.be/2XQlQGf0lnk

## Useage:
This plugin is implemented in the same way as all built in plugins for TinyMCE with the addition of transformers (located in the transformers directory) and an additional class file that also needs to be loaded. Just include transformer and AtlassianAutoconvert.js files after the plugin script.

For more details on implementing additional transformers see: https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Plugin+Tutorial+-+Extending+Autoconvert
